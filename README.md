# Regression - AirBnB Price Prediction

- The aim of this case study is to predict the price of AirBnB listings in major U.S. cities.

### Problem Statement
Given a dataset with 24 variables such as number of bedrooms and a log-price indicator (greater than 0) for each observation in the training data, the objective is to suggest the log-price of a particular listing using the 24 features provided.

Dataset had missing values that have been handled by filling up with mean and mode values.

For categorical variables, both label encoding and one hot encoding has been tried to see the results. 

Mean squared error is the evaluation metric chosen.
